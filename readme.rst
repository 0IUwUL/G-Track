Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

To run this application, it is important to install XAMPP to host a local
web server to see the output of this system. In the installation of XAMPP,
it is imperative to check the Apache and MySQL selection. 

************
Setup
************
Visit the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL. Click on the
admin button along the row of MySQL create a database, name the database as
'expense_tracker' then import the sql file in the database folder found in this
system folder. 

Now open a web browser and visit 'localhost/Expense_Tracker_Elec-4/'
